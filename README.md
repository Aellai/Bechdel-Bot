# Bechdel Bot
The [Bechdel Bot](https://nlp-ug-2021-22.github.io/PaprykarzSzczecinski-Project/) presented is a group project for our web development course. It was created by 3 students, namely [Wiktoria Szwarc](https://github.com/w-szwarc), [Oliwia Ko≈Çecka](https://github.com/okliwia) and [Lara Lejderman](https://github.com/Aellai). The link to the whole repository is provided [here](https://github.com/NLP-UG-2021-22/PaprykarzSzczecinski-Project).

The Bot is based on [Bechdel Test](https://bechdeltest.com), which measures the representation of women in film according to the following criteria: (1) it has to have at least two women in it, (2) who talk to each other, (3) about something besides a man. 

To utilize it, type in the title of the movie you want to check, preceeded by **ttl** and the Bot will tell you whether it passes the test or not. Additionally, with the use of [MoviesDatabase API](https://rapidapi.com/SAdrian/api/moviesdatabase/details), the bot can provide information about the movie, such as the release year, language, genres, rating, and plot. The bot can even tell the user if the movie is worth watching on the basis of the rating.

There are some easter eggs hidden as well, waiting to be discovered while you talk to the Bot, as well as on the page itself. 

Enjoy!
